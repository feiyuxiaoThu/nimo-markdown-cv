I received my Bachelor degree majoring Engineering Mechanics from School of Aerospace, Tsinghua University in July, 2018. I had been to University of Tokyo as a visiting scholar under the supervisor of [[Prof. Junichiro Shiomi](http://www.researcherid.com/rid/B-3644-2013)] of Mechanical Engineering.

My current research mainly focuses on battery integrity in EVs and the lightweight of Automobile, and I am 
also interested on the control, safety and lightweight of Autonomous vehicles.

## Education

__Tsinghua University__
**Aug. 2014 - Jul. 2018**
**Engineering Mechanics, School of Aerospace**
**Undergraduate Student**

I have studied in Tsinghua University since August, 2014, majoring in Engineering Mechanics in Tsien's Excellence in Education Program (TEEP), which is one of the six [Tsinghua Xuetang Talents Programs](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/newthuen/newthuen_cnt/admissions/admissions-1-4.html). During my study in TEEP, I got a profound knowledge in mathematics and physics, which makes me much easier than others to learn new things and do difficult research.

__University of California, Berkeley__
**Jun. 2017 - Aug. 2017**
**Mechanical Engineering**
**Visiting Student Researcher**

From October, 2015 - February, 2016, I worked at [[Prof. Junichiro Shiomi](http://www.researcherid.com/rid/B-3644-2013)]'s Lab in Mechanical Engineering of Tokyo university. My research topic was Multi-scale phonon simulation in nanostructures and phonon interface properties modeling:Heat propagation and Optimization of Nano devicess.

## Experience

### __Carnegie Mellon University, Research Experiences for Undergraduate__  `2017.5 - 2017.8`
_Research Assistant_<br>
__Penrose__ is a system that automatically visualizes mathematics. The system, comprised of two domain-specific languages: __Substance__ and __Style__. Co-advised by [Jonathan Aldrich](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./aldrich/), [Keenan Crane](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/), [Joshua Sunshine](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/), and [Katherine Ye](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kqy/), I designed and implemented the Style language, and extended the Substance language to support functions and logically quantified statements.

### __Columbia Univeristy, Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab__ `2017.1 - 2017.5`
_Research Assistant_<br>
Worked with prof. Steven Feiner, on __Cyber Affordance Visualization in Augumented Reality__ project. Developed a Microsoft Hololens application that visualizes the Columbia campus in AR environment.

### __AsiaInfo__ `2015.6 - 2015.8`
_Software Engineering Intern_<br>
Worked on server-side web applications and server deployment tools.
