I received my Bachelor degree majoring Engineering Mechanics from School of Aerospace, Tsinghua University in July, 2018. I had been to University of Tokyo as a visiting scholar under the supervisor of [[Prof. Junichiro Shiomi](http://www.researcherid.com/rid/B-3644-2013)] of Mechanical Engineering.

My current research mainly focuses on battery integrity in EVs and the lightweight of Automobile, and I am 
also interested on the control, safety and lightweight of Autonomous vehicles.

## Education

__Tsinghua University__
**Aug. 2014 - Jul. 2018**
**Engineering Mechanics, School of Aerospace**
**Undergraduate Student**

I have studied in Tsinghua University since August, 2014, majoring in Engineering Mechanics in Tsien's Excellence in Education Program (TEEP), which is one of the six [Tsinghua Xuetang Talents Programs](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/newthuen/newthuen_cnt/admissions/admissions-1-4.html). During my study in TEEP, I got a profound knowledge in mathematics and physics, which makes me much easier than others to learn new things and do difficult research.

__University of California, Berkeley__
**Jun. 2017 - Aug. 2017**
**Mechanical Engineering**
**Visiting Student Researcher**

From October, 2015 - February, 2016, I worked at [[Prof. Junichiro Shiomi](http://www.researcherid.com/rid/B-3644-2013)]'s Lab in Mechanical Engineering of Tokyo university. My research topic was Multi-scale phonon simulation in nanostructures and phonon interface properties modeling:Heat propagation and Optimization of Nano devicess.
